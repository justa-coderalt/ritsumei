            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I never thought I’d leave California for college, let alone move halfway across the world. But when I got accepted to Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan, something inside me said, “Go.” I wanted a fresh start—new culture, new people, new challenges. Landing in Japan was surreal. Everything looked different. The signs, the sounds, even the air felt unfamiliar. I remember standing in front of the Kinugasa Campus, surrounded by old temples and sleek buildings, thinking, This is really happening.The first few weeks were rough. I barely knew enough Japanese to order lunch, and I felt out of place in every class. But I joined a language exchange group and started talking to other students—some Japanese, some international like me. Slowly, I found my rhythm.I explored Kyoto’s backstreets, tried takoyaki at street stalls, and studied late at night over bowls of instant ramen. My Japanese improved, and I started speaking up in class. One day, I gave a full presentation in Japanese about global politics. My professor smiled and said, “Well done.”

            That moment stayed with me. I didn’t just come to study. I came to grow. And at Ritsumeikan, I found more than a school—I found a new part of myself</p>
